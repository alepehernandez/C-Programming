/* 1) Redefine marks as an array of size 3- so each student can have three grades.
2) Using scanf read three grades for each student as follows:

s[0] (first student) : 80,90,85.  s[1] (second student) : 70,75,80.  s[2] : 76,86,92
s[3]: 90,92,80. s[4]: 66,77, 82

3) Write your program so you can select the largest grade for each student (out of three grades)
4) Average the grades of the 5 students , using the largest grade out of three for each student. Note: you need to average  5 grades each for one student.


#include <stdio.h> 
struct Student { 
    int marks[3]; 
}; 
 
int main() 
{ 
    struct Student s[5]; 
    int i = 0 ; 
    int sum=0; 
    // Ask user to enter student's grade 
    for (i = 0; i < 5; ++i) { 
        printf("\nStudent %d\n",i+1); 
        printf("Enter Grades: "); 
        scanf("%d %d %d", &s[i].marks[0],&s[i].marks[1],&s[i].marks[2]); 
    } 
    // Declare and Initialize MAX for highest grade 
    for (i = 0; i < 5; ++i) 
    { 
        int max=s[i].marks[0]; 
        for(int j =0; j<3;j++) 
        { 
            if(max<s[i].marks[j]) 
            { 
                max=s[i].marks[j]; 
            } 
        } 
        printf("\nStudent %d highest grade: %d",(i+1),max); 
        sum+=max; 
    } 
 
    double avg=sum/5; 
    printf("\nAverage of highest grades is: %lf\n", avg); 
    printf ("\n"); 
    return 0; 
}
