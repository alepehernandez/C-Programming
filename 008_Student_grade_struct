/* 1) Redefine marks as an array of size 3- so each student can have three grades.
2) Using scanf read three grades for each student as follows:

s[0] (first student) : 80,90,85.  s[1] (second student) : 70,75,80.  s[2] : 76,86,92
s[3]: 90,92,80. s[4]: 66,77, 82

3) Write your program so you can select the largest grade for each student (out of three grades)
4) Average the grades of the 5 students , using the largest grade out of three for each student. Note: you need to average  5 grades each for one student.



#include <stdio.h>
struct Student {
   int grade[3];
};

int main() {
    struct Student s[5];
    int i=0;
    
    // Ask user to enter grade for students
    for (i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        printf("Enter Grades for student %d:", (i+1));
        scanf("%d %d %d", &s[i].grade[0],&s[i].grade[1],&s[i].grade[2]);
    }
    
    int sum=0,j;
    for(i=0;i<5; i++)
    {
        //declare and initialize Max variables
    int max=s[i].grade[0];
        //find largest marks for each student
        for(j=0;j<3;j++)
        {
            if(max<s[i].grade[j])
            {
                max=s[i].grade[j];
            }
        }
    printf("Largest grade of Student %d: %d\n",(i+1),max);
    // sum of largest
    sum=sum+max;
}
// find avg
    double avg=sum/5;
    printf("\n AVG of largest marsk is %lf\n",avg);
    return 0;
}
