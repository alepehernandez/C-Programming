/* While loop to check a number is zero or not. Often the number of times a loop is executed is not predetermined. You may use an input value to signify the end of the loop. Such a value is known as a sentinel value. Write a program that reads and calculates the sum of an unspecified number of integers. The input 0 signifies the end of the input. 1,-1,3,5,9,0 so the zero at the end will signify end of the program */
